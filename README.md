I have created RNN model and LSTM model . Also applied Word2vec pre-trained model.


word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors :
This repository hosts the word2vec pre-trained Google News corpus (3 billion running words) word vector model (3 million 300-dimension English word vectors).

To download the pre-trained model, I used the following repository - https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors/blob/master/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz
